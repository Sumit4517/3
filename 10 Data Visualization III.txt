'''To compare distributions and identify outliers in the Iris dataset based on the boxplots, you can visually inspect the boxplots and look for any data points 
that fall significantly outside the whiskers of the boxplots. Outliers are typically defined as
data points that are significantly higher or lower than the rest of the data and can be seen as individual points beyond the whiskers of the boxplots.

Here's how you can interpret the boxplots and identify potential outliers:

Sepal Length (cm):
The boxplot for sepal length shows a relatively normal distribution without any clear outliers.
Sepal Width (cm):
There are a few data points with sepal widths lower than the lower whisker, indicating potential outliers on the lower end of sepal width.
Petal Length (cm):
Petal length appears to have a few outliers on the upper end, as indicated by data points beyond the upper whisker.
Petal Width (cm):
Similar to petal length, petal width also shows outliers on the upper end, beyond the upper whisker of the boxplot.
To summarize:

Sepal width, petal length, and petal width have potential outliers, especially on the upper end.
Sepal length does not show any clear outliers.
These observations are based on the visual inspection of the boxplots. You can further analyze and verify these outliers using statistical 
methods or domain knowledge if needed.'''
